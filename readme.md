# Notes

## Udacity-ipnd-project-01

- Built using a mobile-first approach.
- Picked Python as it represents the only reason for me taking this course.
- I was not sure if there was a max size or how close margins and padding needed to match the provided mockup.
- I took some liberties with the list items and nested an additional OL inside one of the LI's
- validation checks:
  - https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea **no warnings or errors**
  - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator **no warnings or errors**
